SingleObjectMovementDetection
=============================

Problem Statement:
Given the 2 images (image5 is first):
1.	 Outline the object that moved.  Outline the original and new position.
2.	Characterize the motion as a vector in pixels.

Design your algorithm in the most generic way possible to determine the movement of a single object in a series of 2 still images.
